# Optical Character Recognition models

In these models images will be provided and model will recognise the text and try to predict the exact output.
we have two different models in our repositry
## Method 1
 In this model we have used EasyOcr technique to recognise text in the Nationa identity card image.
 
## Method 2
 In this model we have used KerasOcr technique to recognise text in the National identity card image.
## Method 3
 In this model we used the python library of pytesseract and it helps to predict the text from different id card images.
